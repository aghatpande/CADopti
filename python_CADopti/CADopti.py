    """
    This function returns cell assemblies detected in spM spike matrix binned 
    at a temporal resolution specified in 'BinSizes' vector and testing for all 
    lags between '-MaxLags(i)' and 'MaxLags(i)'

    USAGE: [assembly] = Main_assemblies_detection(spM, MaxLags, BinSizes, ref_lag, alph, Dc, No_th, O_th, bytelimit)

    ARGUMENTS:
    spM     := matrix with population spike trains; each row is the spike train (time stamps, not binned) relative to a unit. 
    BinSizes:= vector of bin sizes to be tested;
    MaxLags := vector of maximal lags to be tested. For a binning dimension of BinSizes(i) the program will test all pairs configurations with a time shift between -MaxLags(i) and MaxLags(i);
    (optional) ref_lag      := reference lag. Default value 2
    (optional) alph      := alpha level. Default value 0.05
    (optional) No_th     := minimal number of occurrences required for an assembly (all assemblies, even if significant, with fewer occurrences than No_th are discarded). Default value 0.
    (optional) O_th      := maximal assembly order (the algorithm will return assemblies of composed by maximum O_th elements).
    (optional) bytelimit := maximal size (in bytes) allocated for all assembly structures detected with a bin dimension. When the size limit is reached the algorithm stops adding new units. 

    RETURNS:
    assembly - structure containing assembly information:
        assembly['parameters']       - parameters used to run Main_assemblies_detection
        assembly['bin'][i] contains information about assemblies detected with 
                        'BinSizes[i]' bin size tested for all lags between 
                        '-MaxLags[i]' and 'MaxLags[i]'
    
           assembly['bin'][i]['bin_edges'] - bin edges (common to all assemblies in assembly['bin'][i])
           assembly['bin'][i]['n'][j] information about the j-th assembly detected with BinSizes[i] bin size 
                      elements: vector of units taking part to the assembly (unit order correspond to the agglomeration order)
                           lag: vector of time lags. '.lag[z]' is the activation delay between .elements[0] and .elements[z+1]
                            pr: vector of pvalues. '.pr[z]' is the pvalue of the statistical test between performed adding .elements[z+1] to the structure .elements[0:z]
                          Time: assembly activation time. It reports how many times the complete assembly activates in that bin. .Time always refers to the activation of the first listed assembly element (.elements[0]), that doesn't necessarily corresponds to the first unit firing.
                  Noccurrences: number of assembly occurrence. '.Noccurrences[z]' is the occurrence number of the structure composed by the units .elements[0:z+1] 

    As_across_bins         - structure containing assembly information (exactly same information contained in "assembly" but collected across different temporal resolutions)
    As_across_bins_index   - information to link assemblies in "As_across_bins"
                             back to the structure "assembly":
                             assembly As_across_bins[i] is contained in assembly['bin'][As_across_bins_index[i][0]]['n'][As_across_bins_index[i][1]].
